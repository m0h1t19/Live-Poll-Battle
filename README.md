# Live-Poll-Battle

How I Built It

I leanred my way through NodeJS, ReactJS learned their basic application from online sources, Also learned how to apply websocket through socket.io
It has frontend facility, that users can join and create rooms with the name and vote for options.

backend is simple , which keeps track of rooms, and stores the vote of user so that the user cant vote another time, as soon as a user enters a room the clock starts of 60 seconds and he/she is only able to voted if not voted already.

I got to learn a lot from this project
